# Kinetica framework benchmark harness

A local reimplementation of the keyed scenario of
[js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) (krausest) — the
suite historically used to compare React, Preact, Vue and Svelte — extended with **Kinetica**
(this repo's Kotlin/JS UI framework, app in `../samples/browser-bench`). Everything runs in one
environment: one machine, one local static server, one vendored Chromium, one driver.

Beyond the classic 9 operations the suite measures: partial operations on the 10k table,
GC time inside every operation, scaling curves (complexity-class regression detection),
sustained-update frame timing (dbmonster-style), a deep-tree suite (UIBench-style), memory
churn/leak probes, startup script/blocking time, an optional CPU-throttled pass, plus JVM
microbenchmarks (`../bench-jvm`) and a bundle-size baseline check (`../scripts/size-report.mjs`).

This README is written to be self-sufficient context for an agent asked to add a framework,
re-run the suite, or modify the harness. Read it fully before changing anything.

## Quick start

```sh
cd bench
npm install                 # once; installs framework deps + esbuild
node run-all.mjs            # build everything → bench all frameworks → merge → report
open report/index.html      # the local results page
```

Common variants:

```sh
node run-all.mjs --frameworks=kinetica            # re-bench one framework; other results kept
node run-all.mjs --frameworks=solid               # bench a newly added framework
node run-all.mjs --samples=5 --warmup=1           # quick noisy pass (default 10 + 3)
node run-all.mjs --skip-build                     # bundles unchanged, skip builds
node run-all.mjs --report-only                    # only re-merge parts + regenerate the page
node run-all.mjs --tree                           # also run the deep-tree suite
node run-all.mjs --scaling                        # also run scaling curves
node run-all.mjs --throttle=4                     # 4x CPU-throttled pass → results/throttled/
node run-all.mjs --skip-main --tree               # only the tree suite, keep main parts
node driver/bench.mjs --frameworks=react --bench=04 --samples=3    # one op, for debugging
node driver/bench.mjs --frameworks=react --bench=anim              # only the animation bench
node driver/tree.mjs --frameworks=kinetica --samples=3             # tree suite directly
node driver/scaling.mjs --frameworks=kinetica --sizes=1000,5000,20000 --strict
```

A full default run takes ~20–30 minutes (more with `--tree`/`--scaling`). Frameworks are
benchmarked **sequentially, never in parallel** — parallel Chromiums contend for CPU and corrupt
the timings. Don't run anything CPU-heavy on the machine during a run, and don't run two
`run-all`/driver invocations at once.

The Kinetica apps live outside this directory: `../samples/browser-bench/` (module
`browser-bench`, built through `build-kinetica.mjs`: first `../kotlin build -m browser-bench`,
then esbuild bundles/minifies the linked Kotlin/JS graph into
`../build/tasks/_browser-bench_bundle/browser-bench.bundle.mjs`). Table app at
`../samples/browser-bench/web/index.html`, tree app at the same page with `?app=tree`.
Renderer performance work is planned in `../perf-rewrite-design.md`.

## What is measured

### Main suite (driver/bench.mjs)

Thirteen operations on a keyed table (medians over N samples, after warmup):

| id | operation | measured click | asserted end state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01_run1k | create 1,000 rows | `run` | 1000 `tbody tr` |
| 02_replace1k | replace all 1,000 | `run` (table full) | first row's `data-id` changed |
| 03_update10th1k | update every 10th label | `update` | first label ends with `" !!!"` |
| 04_select1k | select a row | row label link | that `tr` has class `danger` |
| 05_swap1k | swap rows 2 and 999 | `swaprows` | ids at positions 2/999 exchanged |
| 06_remove1k | remove row 5 | row remove link | 999 rows, row-5 id changed |
| 07_create10k | create 10,000 rows | `runlots` | 10000 rows |
| 08_append1k | append 1,000 to 1,000 | `add` | 2000 rows |
| 09_clear1k | clear 1,000 rows | `clear` | 0 rows |
| 10_select10k | select a row in 10k | row label link | `danger` on that row |
| 11_swap10k | swap rows 2/999 in 10k | `swaprows` | ids exchanged |
| 12_remove10k | remove row 5 from 10k | row remove link | 9999 rows |
| 13_update10th10k | update every 10th of 10k | `update` | first label ends with `" !!!"` |

Ops 10–13 do the same DOM work as their 1k counterparts but with 10× the framework
bookkeeping — accidental O(n²) reconciliation shows there first. State is reset between
samples so every measured click does identical work.

**Timing methodology** (krausest-style): the driver clicks with a trusted Playwright event while
a Chrome trace (`devtools.timeline`) records; duration = first click `EventDispatch` start →
end of the last `Paint`/`Commit` event. Not wall-clock around the click — it includes async
flushes, layout and paint. Headless "Chrome for Testing", no CPU throttling by default.
**GC time** per sample is the summed duration of `MinorGC`/`MajorGC`/`V8.GC*`/`BlinkGC.*`
events inside the same measured window (`gcMedianMs`/`gcMaxMs`/`gcMeanCount` per op).

Also collected per framework:

- **startup** — navigation → toolbar rendered, 5 untraced cold loads (comparable with historical
  parts); JS bytes raw/gzip from actual loaded resources; plus 2 *traced* cold loads yielding
  `scriptMs` (merged compile+evaluate intervals) and `tbtMs` (long-task time >50ms, approximate).
- **memory** — JSHeapUsedSize after forced GC at six checkpoints: after load, after 1k rows,
  after 5× replace, after 10× create+clear cycles, after `window.__unmount()`, and after five
  `__mount()`/`__unmount()` cycles. The last two are the leak probe: growth between the first
  unmount and the fifth means the app retains memory per mount cycle.
- **animation** (sustained updates, dbmonster-style) — the driver clicks the app's `animate`
  toggle; the app re-labels every 10th row on every `requestAnimationFrame` until toggled off.
  An injected rAF collector records real frame deltas for `--anim-seconds` (default 6, first
  500ms discarded); reported as fps, median/p95 frame time and % of frames >25ms.

`--throttle=N` applies CDP `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate` to the op and animation contexts
(startup/memory stay unthrottled). Via run-all, throttled parts land in `results/throttled/`
and render as a separate report section — never mixed with unthrottled numbers.

### Deep-tree suite (driver/tree.mjs, run-all --tree)

A keyed tree of depth 4 / fanout 6 → 1,555 nodes, 1,296 leaves (contract in
`frameworks/shared/tree-data.mjs`, Kotlin mirror in the browser-bench module):

| id | operation | asserted end state |
|---|---|---|
| t1_createTree | build a fresh tree | 1555 `.tree-node`, first `data-id` changed |
| t2_updateLeaves | re-label every 10th leaf (preorder) with `" !<tick>"` | status == tick, first leaf suffixed |
| t3_reverseTop | reverse the root's six subtrees (big keyed moves) | first subtree root id changed |
| t4_noopRender | bump only the status counter; tree data unchanged | status == tick |

`t4_noopRender` isolates pure re-render/reconciliation overhead: vdom frameworks re-render all
1,555 components, fine-grained frameworks should approach zero tree work. Tree apps must not use
user-land memoization (no `React.memo` etc.) — framework-internal reuse is the thing measured.

### Scaling curves (driver/scaling.mjs, run-all --scaling)

Select / swap / update measured at 1k, 2k, 5k, 10k, 20k rows (sizes reached through the
standard buttons: `run`/`runlots` + repeated `add`; sizes must be multiples of 1,000), then
fitted as duration ∝ n^exponent (log-log least squares). Select/swap should be near-flat
(threshold 0.6), update near-linear (threshold 1.3); exceeding the threshold flags the op
`superlinear` in the JSON and ⚠ in the report. `--strict` exits 1 on any superlinear op.
Update rebuilds the table between samples (labels mutate cumulatively); select/swap don't.

### JVM microbenchmarks (../bench-jvm)

`../kotlin run -m bench-jvm` (flags after `--`: `--warmup`, `--samples`, `--filter`, `--out`).
Measures what the browser suite can't isolate, in minutes instead of half an hour:
reactive-core propagation (10k-wide derived fan, 1k-deep chain, diamond, cached-read staleness
walk), render-pipeline Node construction (create/update a 1k-row table tree without DOM), and
markdown SSR throughput over the real docs pages. Hand-rolled harness (nanoTime, warmup,
medians, volatile blackhole) — coarser than JMH; treat cross-machine numbers as incomparable.
Output: `results/jvm/results.json`. CI runs it as a smoke test only.

### Bundle sizes (../scripts/size-report.mjs)

`node scripts/size-report.mjs` from the repo root reports gzip/raw sizes of Kinetica's linked
JS output and the bench bundles, compares against `bench/size-baseline.json`, and fails (exit 1)
on >10% gzip growth. CI enforces it; intentional growth is accepted with `--update-baseline`
committed in the same PR. `--measure-build` additionally times a clean and an incremental
`browser-bench` build.

## The app contract (fairness rules — follow exactly)

Every implementation must produce the same page so the DOM work being measured is identical:

1. Render into `<div id="main">` from the page-shell template `build.mjs` generates (it includes
   the `window.__mountMs` snippet the driver needs — don't hand-write pages for JS frameworks).
2. Toolbar of seven `<button>`s addressable as `run`, `runlots`, `add`, `update`, `clear`,
   `swaprows`, `animate` — via `id` or `data-testid` (declare which in the config entry).
3. `<table class="test-data"><tbody>` with one `<tr data-id="<id>">` per row and exactly four
   cells: `td.col-id` (id text) · `td.col-label` containing the clickable **select** control with
   the label text · `td.col-remove` containing the clickable **remove** control wrapping
   `<span class="remove-icon">` · empty `td.col-rest`.
4. The select/remove control is `<a>` (or `<button>` only if the framework cannot attach click
   handlers to anchors — Kinetica's case; declare it as `rowControl` in the config).
5. Selected row carries class `danger` (and only the selected one).
6. Rows MUST be keyed by row id (the point of the suite is keyed reconciliation).
7. Data: the standard generator — copy the logic of `frameworks/shared/data.mjs` (adjective +
   colour + noun, `Math.round(Math.random()*1000)%len`, ids from a global counter). JS frameworks
   import it directly; non-JS frameworks (like Kinetica) replicate it in their language.
8. Operations do what the table above says; swap guards `length > 998`; update mutates every
   10th label by appending `" !!!"`. No custom shortcuts (no manual DOM writes from app code in a
   framework implementation — that's what the `vanilla` baseline is for).
9. **animate** toggles a `requestAnimationFrame` loop: each frame, every 10th row's label becomes
   `label.split(" !")[0] + " !" + tick` (`tick` increments per frame — constant work per frame,
   labels don't grow). The mutation must go through normal framework state → render flow
   (vanilla writes text nodes directly, as its baseline role allows). Toggling off cancels the loop.
10. **`window.__mount()` / `window.__unmount()`** hooks: `__unmount` fully unmounts the app
    through the framework's teardown path (leaving `#main` empty), `__mount` mounts a fresh
    instance. Used (unmeasured) by the memory leak probe.
11. Production build, minified, no dev-mode flags. Same shared CSS; no extra hover styles (hover
    repaints would pollute the paint-based timing).

### Tree app contract (for `treeUrl`)

Toolbar buttons `run`, `update`, `reverse`, `noop` plus a status element (`#status` or
`data-testid="status"`) showing the tick counter. Tree data from
`frameworks/shared/tree-data.mjs` (depth 4, fanout 6, preorder ids, labels `"node <id>"`).
DOM: nested `<div class="tree-node" data-id data-depth>`; leaves contain
`<span class="tree-leaf">`, branches `<span class="tree-label">` + children. Children keyed by
node id. `update` and `noop` both increment the shared tick; `update` re-labels every 10th leaf
(preorder) to `label.split(" !")[0] + " !" + tick`; `reverse` reverses the root's children;
`noop` changes only the status text. No user-land memoization on tree nodes.

## Adding a new framework (checklist)

Example: adding Solid.

1. `npm install solid-js` (in `bench/`).
2. Create `frameworks/solid/main.jsx` implementing the app contract (incl. animate + hooks).
   Crib from `frameworks/preact/main.jsx` (hooks style) or `frameworks/svelte/App.svelte`
   (compiled style). Optionally add `frameworks/solid/tree.jsx` for the tree suite.
3. Register the build(s) in `build.mjs` `targets` (entry point, title; add a plugin/jsx config
   only if the framework needs one — see the svelte entries).
4. **Append** an entry to `frameworks.config.mjs` (never reorder existing entries — list position
   is the chart color slot, and colors must stay stable per framework):
   ```js
   { name: "solid", label: "Solid", url: "/bench/dist/solid/index.html",
     treeUrl: "/bench/dist/solid-tree/index.html",
     buttons: "id", rowControl: "a", version: { package: "solid-js" } }
   ```
5. Smoke it: `node run-all.mjs --frameworks=solid --samples=2 --warmup=0 --tree` — checks build,
   selectors and all assertions end-to-end.
6. Real numbers: `node run-all.mjs --frameworks=solid` (other frameworks' existing parts are
   reused in the merged report; re-run everything only when the environment changed).
7. Sanity-check `report/index.html`: the new column appears, values are plausible (a keyed
   framework lands between vanilla ~1× and React ~1.3× on the geomean; if you see 10×+ on
   partial ops, the implementation probably isn't keyed or is in dev mode).

For a framework whose app lives outside `bench/` (like Kinetica): host the page anywhere under
the repo root, include the `__mountMs` snippet in its HTML (copy from
`../samples/browser-bench/web/index.html`), and declare a `build` command in its config entry.

## Environment assumptions (things that break silently)

- **Vendored browser**: `driver/common.mjs` imports Playwright from `../.tools/playwright/` and
  launches `../.playwright-browsers/chromium-1228/chrome-mac-arm64/...` — macOS-arm64 paths. On
  another machine, adjust both constants there (or set `PLAYWRIGHT_IMPORT` /
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE`).
- **Port 4573** (`BENCH_PORT` to override); the static server serves the whole repo root.
- Numbers are only comparable **within one machine + one Chromium**. After changing either,
  re-run ALL frameworks, and treat `results/part-*-before.json` snapshots as stale history.
- Kinetica's payload/TTI figures use the benchmark's esbuild production bundle over the Kotlin
  Toolchain linked JS output. If you bypass `build-kinetica.mjs` and load
  `_browser-bench_linkJs/browser-bench.mjs` directly, startup will regress to the unminified
  multi-file preview output.
- `results*.json`/`report/index.html` are generated; edit `report/generate.mjs`, not the page.
- Old part files (9 ops, no churn/animation fields) merge cleanly: the report renders missing
  cells as "—". A framework's part gets the new metrics on its next re-bench.

## Interpreting results

- The page's headline is **geometric-mean slowdown** vs the per-operation fastest framework;
  the table shades cells by that factor. Medians everywhere; hover cells/bars for distributions
  (op cells include GC time in the hover).
- Reference points from the 2026-07-06 full run (M4 Max, Chromium 149, 9-op suite): vanilla
  1.02×, Svelte 1.05×, Preact/Vue 1.09×, **Kinetica 1.25×**, React 1.29× — Kinetica is ahead of
  React after the P0–P2 renderer rewrite, allocation hygiene, browser fast-paths and benchmark
  bundling (15.2× before the rewrite; the pre-rewrite snapshot is kept in
  `part-kinetica-before.json` and shown as before/after on the page). The geomean changes
  meaning as ops 10–13 join the suite — re-run all frameworks before comparing.
- Kinetica context: partial ops sit at the paint floor via keyed row memoization; the remaining
  gap is create-op Node construction + GC pressure (see the GC section of the report) and the
  benchmark's Kotlin runtime payload. History, phase gates and root-cause analysis:
  `../perf-rewrite-design.md`. When touching Kinetica code, run its own tests too
  (`../kotlin test -m kinetica-runtime --platform jvm`,
  `node ../build/tasks/_kinetica-browser_linkJsTest/kinetica-browser_test.mjs` after
  `../kotlin build -m kinetica-browser`).
- **Bench on AC power only.** Below ~10% battery, macOS low-power throttling delays every
  headless-Chrome paint to ~2 vsyncs (~30 ms) — for every framework — and every partial op
  reads as ~30 ms with suspiciously tight stddev. Verify the environment with a quick canary
  (`node driver/bench.mjs --frameworks=react --bench=04 --samples=3`; healthy ≈ 7 ms) before
  trusting a run. The same applies to the animation bench (healthy vanilla ≈ display refresh).
